            <li><strong>Tomato Products</strong> including a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>, two tablespoons.</li>
            <li><strong>Spices and Seasonings</strong>, like fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seens, and black pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Lasagna noodles</strong>, one pack.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheeses</strong>, like parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg</strong>, just one for binding the cheese.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. 
                Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, 
                fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. 
                In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. 
                Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. 
                Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, 
                and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, 
                either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
